# 🎉 New Features Successfully Implemented

## ✅ Implementation Summary

I've successfully added the three requested features to your CORDIS Research Explorer:

### 1. 🏠 Research Dashboard Button on Home Page
**Location**: Home page hero section
**Implementation**: 
- Added a second button next to "Launch Research Assistant"
- Button appears for authenticated users only
- Directly launches the Research Dashboard mode
- Features intuitive BarChart3 icon and clear labeling

**Code Changes**:
```tsx
// When user is logged in, show both options
{user ? (
  <>
    <button onClick={() => { setShowApp(true); setShowDashboard(false); }}>
      Launch Research Assistant
    </button>
    <button onClick={() => { setShowApp(true); setShowDashboard(true); }}>
      <BarChart3 className="w-5 h-5" />
      Research Dashboard
    </button>
  </>
) : (
  // ... login/register buttons
)}
```

### 2. 👤 Small Profile Icon on Non-Home Pages
**Location**: App header (when inside the application)
**Implementation**: 
- Shows UserMenu component with profile avatar
- Only displays when user is authenticated
- Positioned in the top-right corner of app header
- Provides access to user settings, logout, etc.

**Code Changes**:
```tsx
// Added to the app header
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <button>Research Dashboard / Research Assistant toggle</button>
  <div>Current Mode indicator</div>
  {user && <UserMenu />}  // ← New profile icon
</div>
```

### 3. 🔍 Search Count Display in Research Assistant
**Location**: ProjectsSearchView component (Research Assistant mode)
**Implementation**: 
- **Two-level display system**:
  1. **Prominent counter** above search input: "Free searches remaining: X / 5"
  2. **Inline badge** next to results count: "X searches left"
- Real-time updates as searches are performed
- Visually distinct styling with theme support
- Clear indication when limit is approached

**Code Changes**:
```tsx
// Above search input
{user && (
  <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 warm:bg-amber-50 px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">
    <span>Free searches remaining:</span>
    <span className="font-semibold">{Math.max(0, 5 - searchCount)} / 5</span>
  </div>
)}

// Next to results count
{user && (
  <span className="px-3 py-1 bg-blue-100 rounded-full text-xs">
    {Math.max(0, 5 - searchCount)} searches left
  </span>
)}
```
