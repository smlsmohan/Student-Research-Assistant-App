## Manual Git Commands to Execute

Since the automated terminal is experiencing issues, please run these commands manually in your terminal:

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd "/Users/mohan/Development/Projects/Mohan_research_app/Student-Research-Assistant-App"
```

### Step 2: Check Current Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### Step 3: Check Current Branch
```bash
git branch
```

### Step 4: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Complete authentication system implementation

- Full authentication system with user registration, login, password reset
- Search limit system (5 free searches per user) with real-time tracking  
- Modal-based authentication with responsive design
- Theme system (Light/Dark/Warm) with proper context management
- User profiles, search history, and bookmarks with RLS policies
- Fixed duplicate profile icons and blank dashboard issues
- TypeScript compilation errors resolved - production ready
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Mobile responsive design across all components"
```

### Step 6: Switch to Main Branch (if needed)
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 7: Merge Changes (if you were on a feature branch)
```bash
# Only run this if you were on a feature branch
git merge your-feature-branch-name
```

### Step 8: Push to Remote Repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

### If Remote Repository Doesn't Exist
If you haven't set up a remote repository yet:
```bash
# Add remote repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/cordis-research-explorer.git

# Push with upstream
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: One-Line Command
If you prefer to run everything at once:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Complete authentication system implementation" && git push origin main
```

## Verification
After pushing, verify your changes are on the remote repository:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```
