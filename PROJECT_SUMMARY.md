# 🎉 CORDIS Research Explorer - Project Complete!

## ✅ What We've Built

A modern, fully-functional Next.js web application for exploring European research projects from the CORDIS database with:

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across 79,069+ research projects
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by programme, country, status, budget, and dates
- **Interactive Stats**: Real-time visualizations of funding and project distributions
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Project Details**: Rich project cards with organization info and funding details
- **Pagination**: Efficient loading of large datasets

### 🏗️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with full type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with your CORDIS data
- **Icons**: Lucide React for beautiful, consistent icons
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel, Docker, or any cloud platform

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:3000

### Automated Setup

Run the setup script for guided installation:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

## 📊 Database Requirements

Your Supabase database should have a `cordis_projects` table with the CORDIS data loaded. This is typically done using the ETL pipeline in the parent directory.

**Required columns**: id, acronym, title, objective, status, dates, funding info, organizations, topics, etc.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Development
1. **Customize the UI**: Modify components in `src/components/`
2. **Add features**: Extend search, add new visualizations
3. **Improve performance**: Add caching, optimize queries
4. **Add analytics**: Track user interactions

### For Production
1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Easiest option with automatic CI/CD
2. **Set up monitoring**: Add error tracking and analytics
3. **Configure security**: Enable RLS in Supabase
4. **Scale as needed**: Monitor usage and optimize
