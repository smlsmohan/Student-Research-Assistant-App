# 🔧 Critical Issues Fixed

## ✅ All Issues Resolved Successfully

I've successfully fixed all three critical issues you reported:

### 1. 🏠 **Research Dashboard Page Was Blank** - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: The Dashboard component was using an undefined `isAuthenticated` variable, causing it to not render properly.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper `useAuth()` hook import and usage
- Replaced `isAuthenticated` with `user` from the auth context
- Dashboard now displays correctly with all analytics, charts, and features

**Changes Made**:
```tsx
// Added proper auth context usage
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';

export function Dashboard() {
  const { user } = useAuth(); // ✅ Now properly defined
  
  // Fixed all references from isAuthenticated to user
  {user ? "Discover European research opportunities" : "Sign in to unlock full research features"}
  {user && <SearchLimitWarning />}
}
```

### 2. 🔑 **Forgot Password Option in Login Page** - ADDED ✅

**Problem**: The login form had forgot password functionality implemented but no UI button to access it.

**Solution**:
- Added "Forgot your password?" link below the login button
- Links to the existing password reset form that was already implemented
- Clean, accessible design that toggles the reset form

**Changes Made**:
```tsx
// Added forgot password link in login form
<div className="text-center">
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={() => setShowResetForm(!showResetForm)}
    className="text-sm text-primary hover:text-primary/80 font-medium"
  >
    Forgot your password?
  </button>
</div>
```

### 3. 🔐 **Reset Password Option in Profile Section** - ADDED ✅

**Problem**: Users had no way to reset their password from within the application after logging in.

**Solution**:
- Added "Reset Password" option to the UserMenu dropdown
- Automatically uses the current user's email
- Shows confirmation messages and handles errors gracefully
- Clean, intuitive UI that fits seamlessly into existing design

**Changes Made**:
```tsx
// Added reset password functionality to UserMenu
const handleResetPassword = async () => {
  const { error } = await resetPassword(user.email)
  // Handle success/error messages
}

// Added UI elements
<button onClick={() => setShowResetForm(!showResetForm)}>
  <Key className="w-4 h-4" />
  <span>Reset Password</span>
</button>
```
